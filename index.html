      <p>
        With the rising tide of steam power and machinery, who can come close to being a Beyonder? Shrouded in the fog

      </p>
      <p>
        Waking up to be faced with a string of mysteries, Zhou Mingrui finds himself reincarnated as Klein Moretti in an
        alternate Victorian era world where he sees a world filled with machinery, cannons, dreadnoughts, airships,
        difference machines, as well as Potions, Divination, Hexes, Tarot Cards, Sealed Artifacts…
      </p>
      <p>
        The Light continues to shine but mystery has never gone far. Follow Klein as he finds himself entangled with the
        Churches of the world—both orthodox and unorthodox—while he slowly develops newfound powers thanks to the
        Beyonder potions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like the corresponding tarot card, The Fool, which is numbered 0—a number of unlimited potential—this is the
        legend of “The Fool”.
