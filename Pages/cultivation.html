        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Until he became the lowest-ranked master, his lonely and luckless life
          never changed. Suddenly one day, a descendant injected him with a
          nanomachine, and the machine started ‘speaking’ to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          [I am the seventh generation Nanomachine manufactured by Sky
          Cooperation, and I am operating as a central nerve connected to your
          brain.] “What? What are you talking about?”
        </p>
        <p>
          This was beyond the boy’s knowledge, he turned pale. The Nanomachine
          linked to his cerebrum realized the User was not understanding a
          single word it said. “Who are you, and why are you doing this to me?”
        </p>
        <p>
          [“I am the seventh generation Nanomachine.] “Nano Mashin?” [Yes,
          Nanomachine.] The boy’s face hardened. Mashin was the deity the Mashin
          Religion worshipped, along with the Sacred Fire. The religions’ Master
          communicated with Mashin. “Um, are you really Mashin?” The boy knelt
          down and asked with a trembling voice. At this, the Nanomachine
          attached to his cerebrum realized it had been misunderstood.
